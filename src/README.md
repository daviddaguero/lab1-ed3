- The `include` folder contains header files for the project. These files declare the functions and data structures used throughout the codebase.
- The `src` folder contains the source code files. These files implement the functionality declared in the header files.
- The `build` folder is where the compiled binaries and other build artifacts are stored. This folder is typically generated during the build process and may not be present in the source repository. This folder should not be add to git tracking!

Please make sure to read through all the files and understand the project structure before making any changes.
